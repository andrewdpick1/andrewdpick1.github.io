Rosalind challenge answers: 

Challenge #2 - Variables and Some Arithmetic

a = 848
b = 856
a = a**2
b = b**2
result = a + b
print(result)

Challenge #3 - Strings and Lists

#notes: f' calls for the literal value of the following variables
#notes: curly braces ask for the literal of each variable after the f'
#notes: the square brackets are slicing out particular characters from the given string at the character numbers provided in the brackets. It's kind of like a range.

dataset = 'HumptyDumptysatonawallHumptyDumptyhadagreatfallAlltheKingshorsesandalltheKingsmenCouldntputHumptyDumptyinhisplaceagain.'

word1start = 22
word1finish = 27
word2start = 97
word2finish = 102
print(f'{dataset[word1start:word1finish + 1]} {dataset[word2start:word2finish + 1]}')

Challenge #4 - Conditions and Loops
#notes: % 2 != 0 says: if the number's remainder when divided by 2 does not equal 0.
#notes: odd_sum += number adds the value of 'number' to 'odd_sum' in each iteration, accumulating the sum of odd numbers.
 
a = 100
b = 200

odd_sum = 0
for number in range(a, b):
    if number % 2 != 0:
        odd_sum += number
print(f'The value of the sum of the odd integers between {a} and {b} is {odd_sum}.')

Challenge #5 - Working with Files
#notes: The with statement is used for file handling, ensuring proper opening and closing of the file.
# 'r' reads the files without modifying them.
# The as file part allows use of the variable file to interact with the file object. 

line_count = 1

with open('openthis.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        if line_count % 2 == 0:
            print(line)
        line_count +=1 
    
Challenge #6 - Dictionaries



txtStr = 'input text here'
wordcountdict = {}

for word in txtStr.split():
    if word in wordcountdict:
        wordcountdict[word] +=1
    else:
        wordcountdict[word] = 1

for key, value in wordcountdict.items():
    print(key, value)

for key, value in txtStr:
    print(key)

OR

from collections import Counter

txtStr = 'input text here'

# Use Counter to count word occurrences
wordcountdict = Counter(txtStr.split())

# Print the word frequencies
for word, count in wordcountdict.items():
    print(word, count)
